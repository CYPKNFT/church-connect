      question: "How do I post a need for help?",
      answer: "Click the 'Post a Need' button in the navigation menu or dashboard. Fill out the 4-step form with details about what you need help with, choose the appropriate category, set urgency level, and add location details. Your need will be visible to church members who can volunteer to help."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I volunteer to help someone?",
      answer: "Browse available needs on the 'Community Needs' page. Use filters to find opportunities that match your skills and availability. Click 'Volunteer' on any need card to offer your help. The person who posted the need will be notified and can contact you directly."
    },
    {
      question: "Is my personal information safe?",
      answer: "Yes, your privacy and safety are our top priorities. Only verified church members can see your posts. We never share personal information without consent. Contact details are only shared when you volunteer or when someone offers to help you."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I need to cancel my volunteering commitment?",
      answer: "Life happens! If you need to cancel, please contact the person you committed to help as soon as possible through the app messaging system or phone. This gives them time to find alternative help or reschedule."
    },
    {
      question: "How are volunteers verified?",
      answer: "All users must be verified church members. New accounts require pastoral approval before posting or volunteering. We also have a community rating system where users can rate their experiences to build trust."
    },
    {
      question: "What types of help can I request?",
      answer: "You can request help with transportation, groceries, home repairs, meals, childcare, prayer support, and many other needs. If your need doesn't fit standard categories, use 'Other' and describe what you need in detail."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I schedule help for a future date?",
      answer: "Absolutely! When posting your need, you can specify your preferred timing in the description. Many church members are happy to schedule help in advance, especially for regular needs like grocery shopping or transportation."
    },
    {
      question: "What if no one volunteers for my need?",
      answer: "Don't worry! Needs stay active for 30 days. Try reaching out to church staff who can help connect you with specific ministry groups. You can also edit your post to add more details or adjust timing to make it easier for volunteers."
